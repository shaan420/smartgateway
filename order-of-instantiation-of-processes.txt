1. DataManager
This is a standalone process

2. DeviceAgent
This communicates with DataManager only

3. RuleManager
This communicates with DataManager and QueryAgent

4. QueryAgent
This communicates with DM, RM, DA

5. HTTPServ
This communicates with QA.

Basically we see a deadlock between RM and QA.
Need to resolve this dependency.
